# H2-Smart-Control
Smart Control Process System for  Hydrogen production from Renewable Energy sources
# Summary

This project presents a smart hydrogen production prototype that leverages real-time solar and wind energy data, combined with machine learning, to recommend optimal hydrogen production rates and monitor efficiency. The system features a live dashboard for operators, translating limited data into actionable insights for improved sustainability and resource utilization. Designed for scalability, the prototype provides an immediate digital upgrade for hydrogen plants and is ready to incorporate additional capabilities like storage, logistics management, and predictive maintenance as more operational data becomesÂ available.
